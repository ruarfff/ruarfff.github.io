The following is a list of the best resources I have found while trying to become a better developer in the second half of 2020.</p>\n<h2>Contents</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#community\">Community</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#projects-and-tools\">Projects</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#learning-and-practice\">Learning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#good-news\">Good News</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#videos\">Videos</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#articles-and-sites\">Articles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#podcasts\">Podcasts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#conferences\">Conferences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#books\">Books</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#funny\">Funny</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#gadgets\">Gadgets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#twitter\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#coding-music\">Coding Music</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Community <a name=\"community\"></a></h2>\n<p>In the second half of this year, I discovered <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/\">Indie Hackers</a>. I really like the content and ideas there. If you are looking to work on a side project it’s certainly worth a look.</p>\n<h2>Projects and Tools <a name=\"projects-and-tools\"></a></h2>\n<p>A brief list of the best tools I discovered and used recently.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://backstage.io/\">Backstage</a></strong></p>\n<p>When I worked at Spotify I was blown away by the internal tooling and how quickly I could get set up and deploying code. I got to use an early version of the developer portal there which has since been opensourced. We are using this at my company now and it’s really worth a look if you want a nice way to do internal tooling.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/backstage/backstage\">Backtsage GitHub repo</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-boundary\">Hashicorp Boundary</a></strong></p>\n<p>Most access tools I’ve had to use kind of suck if your job is actually making stuff (looking at you Cyberark). <a href=\"https://www.boundaryproject.io/\">Hashicorp Boundary</a> looks like a really promising alternative so far.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.blog/2020-09-17-github-cli-1-0-is-now-available/\">GitHub CLI</a></strong></p>\n<p>GitHub CLI is a great tool and a lot of fun to use.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cli/cli\">GitHub CLI repo</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://sizzy.co/\">Sizzy</a></strong></p>\n<p>A browser for devs that is very cool.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/kubectl\">ZSH Kubectl plugin</a></strong></p>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://www.zsh.org/\">zsh</a> + <a href=\"https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh\">ohmyzsh</a> and I work with Kubernetes a bit. It only occurred to me to use the kubectl plugin for zsh recently which is silly but I am happy I am using it now.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-with-me.html\">Jetbrains Code with me</a></strong></p>\n<p>VSCode has had <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share\">Live Share</a> for a while. A lot of people prefer Jetbrains tools though so I was happy to see this: <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-with-me.html\">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-with-me.html</a></p>\n<h2>Learning and Practice <a name=\"learning-and-practice\"></a></h2>\n<p>This article encouraged me to make this list <a href=\"https://www.learninpublic.org/v1-principles-learn-in-public.pdf\">https://www.learninpublic.org/v1-principles-learn-in-public.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://testingjavascript.com/\">Testing JavaScript</a> is unfortunately quite expensive but this is a subject I keep struggling with despite having a lot of experience with it. That course has changed how I think about writing tests in JavaScript and has made me feel more confident that I understand what’s going on now.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn about using GCP (Google Cloud Platform), <a href=\"https://www.qwiklabs.com/\">QwikLabs</a> is a great resource where you learn by doing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://repl.it/\">repl.it</a> is a site that seems to consistently deliver amazing content and is also a very nice site to use. I recommend signing up for the newsletter.</p>\n<p>I am not looking to interview soon but I suffer serious interview anxiety. To help reduce the stress I practice as often as I can. I love the 30 days challenges at <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/\">LeetCode</a>.\nMy last attempt (I didn’t finish the month) <a href=\"https://github.com/ruarfff/leetcode-typescript-practice\">https://github.com/ruarfff/leetcode-typescript-practice</a>.\nWill try again in January.</p>\n<p>I love to code games but I haven’t done much of that since college. I get to dabble a little in it using <a href=\"https://screeps.com/\">Screeps</a>. An RTS game where you code the AI for your units. It’s a lot of fun and good coding practice.</p>\n<p>This is my admittedly poor attempt so far: <a href=\"https://github.com/ruarfff/screeps-scripts\">https://github.com/ruarfff/screeps-scripts</a></p>\n<p>This massive list of resources to learn and practice with:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming\">https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming</a></p>\n<h2>Good News <a name=\"good-news\"></a></h2>\n<p>Just some good tech news I came across recently.</p>\n<p>I did not realise that cookie banners were only required if you use cookies not needed for a site to function i.e. evil tracking cookies and the like. This is good news from GitHub:\n<a href=\"https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/\">https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/</a></p>\n<p>I love Hashicorp. I for sure might be wrong but I consider this good news for people like me who spend a lot of time automating deployments and I am very much looking forward to trying it out: <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-waypoint\">https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-waypoint</a></p>\n<h2>Videos <a name=\"videos\"></a></h2>\n<p>I could watch GeePaw code all day. There’s something so modest and natural about this series. It doesn’t make me feel stupid and I am learning a lot from it: <a href=\"https://www.geepawhill.org/series/real-programming/\">https://www.geepawhill.org/series/real-programming/</a></p>\n<p>Rich Hickey is a great speaker and <a href=\"https://clojure.org/\">clojure</a> is my most favourite language I never use for anything:</p>\n<iframe\n        width=\"560\"\n        height=\"400\"\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MCZ3YgeEUPg\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        allowfullscreen>\n    </iframe>\n<p>If you have been struggling to get going with machine learning despite lots of <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\">Coursera</a> courses done, the insights here might be interesting to you:</p>\n<iframe\n        width=\"560\"\n        height=\"400\"\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHXwFhitqvo\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        allowfullscreen>\n    </iframe>\n<h2>Articles and Sites <a name=\"articles-and-sites\"></a></h2>\n<p>Despite all the improvements in hardware, software performance, in general, doesn’t feel like it has improved at the same speed. This is an interesting read on that subject:\n<a href=\"https://fabiensanglard.net/silicone/\">https://fabiensanglard.net/silicone/</a></p>\n<p>Some crazy JavaScript demos: <a href=\"https://www.dwitter.net/\">https://www.dwitter.net/</a></p>\n<p>Something I used in college but only rediscovered recently <a href=\"https://processing.org/\">https://processing.org/</a>. It’s a very interesting project to help with visualisations in code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.geepawhill.org/\">GeePaw</a> is great. These articles are particularly good ones I read recently:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.geepawhill.org/2020/07/17/the-rat-rework-avoidance-theory/\">https://www.geepawhill.org/2020/07/17/the-rat-rework-avoidance-theory/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.geepawhill.org/2020/08/14/pathing-a-style-of-laying-out-work/\">https://www.geepawhill.org/2020/08/14/pathing-a-style-of-laying-out-work/</a></p>\n<p>I don’t think I will ever go into management but I still love every post by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy\">@mipsytipsy</a> at <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/\">https://charity.wtf/</a>. I appreciate the extra insight I get about management.</p>\n<p>If you have worked in a “big corp”, you have almost certainly encountered bad COTS (“commercial, off the shelf” software): <a href=\"https://sboots.ca/2020/09/16/fake-cots-and-the-one-day-rule/\">https://sboots.ca/2020/09/16/fake-cots-and-the-one-day-rule/</a></p>\n<p>Pretty much every article by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KentBeck\">Kent Beck</a> is great. This is a good one I read recently:\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/monolith-services-theory-practice-617e4546a879\">https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/monolith-services-theory-practice-617e4546a879</a></p>\n<p>A reminder about the risk in crypto:\n<a href=\"https://decrypt.co/51692/a-crypto-user-sent-50000-to-a-smart-contract-its-gone-forever\">https://decrypt.co/51692/a-crypto-user-sent-50000-to-a-smart-contract-its-gone-forever</a></p>\n<p>Generally, I am not a fan of the “why I left some big tech company” posts but there was something really nice about this one:\n<a href=\"https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/\">https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/</a>.</p>\n<p>Some tips on working on a side project while not immediately having to quit the day job: <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/article/f7697df2d7\">https://www.indiehackers.com/article/f7697df2d7</a></p>\n<p>If you ever worked at a “big corp”, you have probably encountered pain with certs on the network. This series helped me understand this stuff better and I learned a bit of rust too:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dev.to/wayofthepie/a-rust-cli-for-decoding-certs-280i\">https://dev.to/wayofthepie/a-rust-cli-for-decoding-certs-280i</a></p>\n<p>Bit of a cheat here since this site isn’t really on tech but it isn’t 100% not tech either and I love it a lot: <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/\">https://www.brainpickings.org/</a></p>\n<h2>Podcasts <a name=\"podcasts\"></a></h2>\n<p>I listen to a great many tech podcasts. One I discovered late in 2020 is the Idealcast and I highly recommend it for its positivity and thought-provoking content:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itrevolution.com/the-idealcast-podcast/\">https://itrevolution.com/the-idealcast-podcast/</a></p>\n<h2>Conferences <a name=\"conferences\"></a></h2>\n<p>I was lucky to get to go to <a href=\"https://events.itrevolution.com/\">The DevOps Summit</a> in October. The focus was largely on dealing with problems in large organisations and more on culture than tech but this is a problem I care a lot about lately. I really loved this conference and how they made the virtual &#x26; remote aspects work well. I loved chatting with the speakers in slack for example.</p>\n<p>I also got to attend <a href=\"https://githubuniverse.com/\">GitHub Universe</a>. It’s one of the most fun conferences for developers I think as you end up trying out so many new things at it. They have done a great job of going virtual too.</p>\n<h2>Books <a name=\"books\"></a></h2>\n<p>When I was at the DevOps Summit I attended a talk by <a href=\"https://markschwartz.me/\">Mark Schwartz</a> and learned about his new book <a href=\"https://itrevolution.com/delicate-art-of-bureaucracy/\">The (Delicate) Art of Bureaucracy</a>. It’s not the kind of book I would ever have thought to buy, to be honest, but the talk was so entertaining I decided to give it a go. It ended up being one of my favourite books this year. If you struggle with bureaucracy in any aspect of life, you will likely find something useful in this book.</p>\n<p>Brain melting assembly problems <a href=\"https://www.xorpd.net/pages/xchg_rax/snip_00.html\">https://www.xorpd.net/pages/xchg_rax/snip_00.html</a>. I can’t really review this book except to say it hurts my brain but I still love it. It’s free but you can support the author by getting a hard copy.</p>\n<p>I got into coding late in life and really messed up in my younger years by completely ignoring maths. The book <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/math-for-programmers\">Math for Programmers</a> has helped me catch up a little bit and fill in some of the gaps in my knowledge left by a squandered youth.</p>\n<p>I read the first edition of <strong>Release It!</strong> by <a href=\"https://www.michaelnygard.com/\">Michael Nygard</a> about 5 years ago and it changed how I thought about running apps in production in a big way. I am now reading <a href=\"https://pragprog.com/titles/mnee2/release-it-second-edition/\">Release It! Second Edition</a> and I am learning just as much again looking at it with more personal experience and enjoying some nice updates in the book.</p>\n<h2>Funny <a name=\"funny\"></a></h2>\n<p>Some amazing CSS <a href=\"https://tholman.com/obnoxious/\">https://tholman.com/obnoxious/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Microservices</strong></p>\n<iframe\n        width=\"560\"\n        height=\"400\"\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y8OnoxKotPQ\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        allowfullscreen>\n    </iframe>\n<p><strong>All your programming pain in one video…</strong></p>\n<iframe\n        width=\"560\"\n        height=\"400\"\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ePhAj8ktiEA\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        allowfullscreen>\n    </iframe>\n<h2>Gadgets <a name=\"gadgets\"></a></h2>\n<p>The only gadget I bought for my dev setup in the last 6 months was this keyboard: <a href=\"https://dygma.com/\">https://dygma.com/</a>.
